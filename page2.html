    <br />
    My family is from
    <b>Ecuador</b>
    <br />
    <br />
    Both my mother and father, (Madelaine + Fausto) were born in
    <b>Quito, Ecuador</b>
    .
    <br />
    <br />

    On my
    <b>maternal side</b>
    , my grandmother (Abu Glady’s) is also from Quito but her mother (Marta), my
    great-grandmother, was from Ibarra. My grandmother’s father (Bolivar), my
    great-grandfather, is also from Quito, but his father (Ramon), (my great,
    great, grandfather) is from Cali, Colombia. My grandfather, (Abuelito
    Enrique) is also from Quito and so is his father (Edwardo), my
    great-grandfather. My grandfather’s mother on the other hand, my
    great-grandma (Antuquita), is from Ambato, Ecuador.
    <br />
    <br />

    On my
    <b>paternal side</b>
    , my grandmother (Suzy) is from Quito but her mother, (Abuelita Quitita), my
    great-grandmother is from Ibarra and so is my great, great, grandmother
    (Celia). My dad’s father (Nestor) was also from Quito but that’s all we know
    about him. My father was fortunate to be raised only by the matriarchs of
    his family. And come to think of it, maybe that’s why he feels his emotions
    so deeply which is really rare for Ecuadorian men.

    <br />

    It is important for me to give the geographical location of where my lineage
    and family comes from.
    <br />
    <br />
    As you can tell, my family called Ecuador home for
    <b>many, many, many years</b>
    . I was never raised here but I have a deep connection to my ancestral land.
    <br />
    <br />
    <i>This is my home too</i>
    <br />
    <br />

    Now that you know some basics of my lineage, lets time travel to when my
    parents immigrated to the USA,
    <a href="page3.html">New York City</a>
    to be exact.
