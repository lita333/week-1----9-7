I often find myself struggling to describe who I am — maybe its because i’m still <i>learning</i> <br />
Maybe its because i’m still <i>growing</i> but i find it harder to explain where is <i>home</i>. 
<br /><br />
What makes a place a <i>home?</i>
<br /><br />
Is it a house where we grew up? <br /><br />
A country where we were born? <br /><br />
Is it where the people we love and care about live? <br /><br />
Or does home <i>move</i> with us <i>wherever we go?</i> <br /><br />

I’m not quite sure what the answer is, but i hope by the end of this, i’ll have a more clear idea of what <i>home</i> is to me.
