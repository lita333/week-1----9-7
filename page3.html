    My parents immigrated to America in 1990 and I was born shortly after in
    1993.

    I am from Corona, Queens — and if you’re from New York, you know every
    Ecuadorian and their mother lives here or at least live in close proximity
    to Roosevelt Ave.

    I called this neighborhood
    <i>home</i>
    for 7 years before moving to
