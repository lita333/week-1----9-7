New York has been *home* now for almost 7 years and what a ride it has been.  <br /> <br />

I moved here with just some clothes and records.  <br />

I tried the corporate life when I initally got here but it wasn’t me.  <br /> <br />

Music has always held me together and has always comforted me.  <br />

I never planned to be a DJ but I was a bedroom DJ until I made friends in New York — and now looking back, that was the best decision I made for myself.  <br />

I’ve been dj’ing professonally for about 6 years now and I can’t begin to describe where that joureny alone has taken me. I’ve played for big brands, festivals, companies. I’ve even opened up for some of my favorite artists. It even got me in grad school. <br /><br /><br />
