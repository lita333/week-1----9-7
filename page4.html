    My extremely hard working parents beat all the odds and were able to buy a
    <i>home</i>
    in Houston, Texas — Cypress, Texas to be exact.
    <br />
    They learned a new language, worked their ass off and persevered
    <br />
    They completely defeated all the obstacles most immigrants face and despite
    coming to this country with nothing — no family, no money, no language, they
    were able to give me and my brother a real
    <i>home</i>
    <br />
    A
    <i>home</i>
    where I had a real backyard A
    <i>home</i>
    where I had my own bedroom
    <br />
    <br />
    No amount of thank-you’s or i love you can suffice for this type of
    sacrifice.
    <br />
    <br />
    I am deeply grateful for how they protected me and tried their best to give
    me and my brother everything they never had
    <br />
    but Texas was my parents dream, not mine.
