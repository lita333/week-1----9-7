Austin to me was my safe haven. It’s where all the weirdos and hippies go.  <br /><br />

I lived in between San Marcos and Austin and called this place <i>home</i> for about 7 years.  <br /><br />

I graduated from Texas State and shortly after I worked this retail job I absolutely hated but paid me enough to fund my move.  <br /> <br />

I have some of my most care-free memories here.  <br /> <br />

Austin in a weird way saved me and made me feel like it was okay to be me. I finally had friends who understood me, who were like me, who were into the things I was into and this made me feel less alone.<br />
It fueled me. It showed me that I can absolutely exist as me.  <br /><br />

Thinking about this time in my life makes me want to cry. There are so many things I can say about Austin, but to sum it up, I am so thankful I got to call this place <i>home</i>.  <br /> <br />

There wasn’t this incessant urge to leave Austin, but it has always been my dream to move back to New York. My intuition has always been my compass, so the moment I felt it was time to move, I packed 3 suitcases and moved to <a href="page8.html">New York City</a>
