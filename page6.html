Suburbia hell to me was Cypress. <br />
I knew this place was hell the moment I was placed in a class that was meant to help me improve my English language skills (ESL) in the 2nd grade. <br /><br />

I never really fit in that town. There was minimal diversity, which meant zero ecuadorians. <br />

There wasn’t people who had my hair or my eyes. <br />

Kids can be so cruel and my earliest memories here where of being stripped from my native language and being bullied at school for having “puffy hair and big eyes”. <br />

As i got older, the more out of place I felt. At home and school. <br />

There is a heavy cultural difference and disconnect between parents and first gen kids. I wasn’t exactly an easy kid either. <br />

I was curious, rebellious, I was too out-spoken and argumentative. In a town where everyone is a carbon copy of each other, it felt like resistance to preserve myself. <br />

Can you imagine what it was like for Ecuadorian parents to have a daughter like this? <br />

I didn’t understand why I was so different or didn’t fit in. I couldn’t even understand why I was so angry at the world. Some call it a phase or teenage angst, but I just knew I couldn’t exist as me here. <br /><br />

And despite always feeling out of place in that town, this was <i>home</i> too. It is where my parents still live and its a place that gave me courage. <br /><br />

Courage to be and courage to leave. <br /><br />

It’s also where i developed my greatest gift — daydreaming. <br /><br />

I spent hours daydreaming about moving back to New York but to make that reality happen, I knew I had to figure out a way to leave Houston.<br /><br />

And thats how I ended up in <a href="page7.html">Austin</a>.
